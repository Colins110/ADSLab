 abstract = {Modern distributed storage systems provide large-scale, fault-tolerant data storage. To reduce the probability of data unavailability, it is important to recover the lost data of any failed storage node efficiently. In practice, storage nodes are of heterogeneous types and have different transmission bandwidths. Thus, traditional recovery solutions that simply minimize the number of data blocks being read may no longer be optimal in a heterogeneous environment. We propose a cost-based heterogeneous recovery (CHR) algorithm for RAID-6-coded storage systems. We formulate the recovery problem as an optimization model in which storage nodes are associated with generic costs. We narrow down the solution space of the model to make it practically tractable, while still achieving the global optimal solution in most cases. We implement different recovery algorithms and conduct testbed experiments on a real networked storage system with heterogeneous storage devices. We show that our CHR algorithm reduces the total recovery time of existing recovery solutions in various scenarios.},
