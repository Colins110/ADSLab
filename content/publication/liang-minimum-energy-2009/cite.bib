 abstract = {A wireless ad hoc network consists of mobile nodes that are powered by batteries. The limited battery lifetime imposes a severe constraint on the network performance, energy conservation in such a network thus is of paramount importance, and energy efficient operations are critical to prolong the lifetime of the network. All-to-all multicasting is one fundamental operation in wireless ad hoc networks, in this paper we focus on the design of energy efficient routing algorithms for this operation. Specifically, we consider the following minimum-energy all-to-all multicasting problem. Given an all-to-all multicast session consisting of a set of terminal nodes in a wireless ad hoc network, where the transmission power of each node is either fixed or adjustable, assume that each terminal node has a message to share with each other, the problem is to build a shared multicast tree spanning all terminal nodes such that the total energy consumption of realizing the all-to-all multicast session by the tree is minimized. We first show that this problem is NP-complete. We then devise approximation algorithms with guaranteed approximation ratios. We also provide a distributed implementation of the proposed algorithm. We finally conduct experiments by simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms all the other known algorithms.},
