abstract: Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM) is extensively studied in recent years.
  Recent work proposed to improve the write performance of STT-RAM through relaxing
  the retention time of STT-RAM cell, magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). Unfortunately,
  frequent refresh operations of volatile STT-RAM could dissipate significantly extra
  energy. In addition, refresh operations can severely conflict with normal read/write
  operations and results in degraded cache performance. This paper proposes Cache
  Coherence Enabled Adaptive Refresh (CCear) to minimize refresh operations for volatile
  STT-RAM. Through novel modifications to cache coherence protocol, CCear can effectively
  minimize the number of refresh operations on volatile STT-RAM. Full-system simulation
  results show that CCear approaches the performance of the ideal refresh policy with
  negligible overhead.
