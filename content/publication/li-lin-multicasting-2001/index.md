abstract: This paper addresses the problem of multicasting and broadcasting in undirected
  wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) networks. Given an undirected network G=(VE)
  with a source nodes and a set of destination nodes D, /spl Lambda/ is the set of
  wavelength that can be used in the network. Associated with every edge e, there
  is a set of available wavelengths on it. The multicast problem is to find a tree
  rooted at s including all nodes in D such that the cost of the tree is minimum in
  terms of the cost of wavelength conversion at nodes and the cost of using wavelength
  on edges. This paper proves that the multicast problem is NP-complete and can not
  be approximated within a constant factor, unless P=NP. Then we construct an auxiliary
  graph for the original WDM networks and reduce the multicast problem to a group
  Steiner tree problem on the auxiliary graph. Employing the known algorithm for the
  group Steiner tree problem, we derive an algorithm for the problem, which delivers
  a solution within O(log/sup 2/ (nk)loglog(nk)logp) times the optimum.
