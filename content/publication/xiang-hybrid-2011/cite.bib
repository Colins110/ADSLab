 abstract = {The current parallel storage systems use thousands of inexpensive disks to meet the storage requirement of applications. Data redundancy and/or coding are used to enhance data availability, for instance, Row-diagonal parity (RDP) and EVENODD codes, which are widely used in RAID-6 storage systems, provide data availability with up to two disk failures. To reduce the probability of data unavailability, whenever a single disk fails, disk recovery will be carried out. We find that the conventional recovery schemes of RDP and EVENODD codes for a single failed disk only use one parity disk. However, there are two parity disks in the system, and both can be used for single disk failure recovery. In this article, we propose a hybrid recovery approach that uses both parities for single disk failure recovery, and we design efficient recovery schemes for RDP code (RDOR-RDP) and EVENODD code (RDOR-EVENODD). Our recovery scheme has the following attractive properties: (1) “read optimality” in the sense that our scheme issues the smallest number of disk reads to recover a single failed disk and it reduces approximately 1/4 of disk reads compared with conventional schemes; (2) “load balancing property” in that all surviving disks will be subjected to the same (or almost the same) amount of additional workload in rebuilding the failed disk. We carry out performance evaluation to quantify the merits of RDOR-RDP and RDOR-EVENODD on some widely used disks with DiskSim. The offline experimental results show that RDOR-RDP and RDOR-EVENODD outperform the conventional recovery schemes of RDP and EVENODD codes in terms of total recovery time and recovery workload on individual surviving disk. However, the improvements are less than the theoretical value (approximately 25%), as RDOR-RDP and RDOR-EVENODD change the disk access pattern from purely sequential to a more random one compared with their conventional schemes.},
