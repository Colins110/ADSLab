abstract: This paper studies the recovery from multiple node failures in distributed
  storage systems. We design a mutually cooperative recovery (MCR) mechanism for multiple
  node failures. Via a cut-based analysis of the information flow graph, we obtain
  a lower bound of maintenance bandwidth based on MCR. For MCR, we also propose a
  transmission scheme and design a linear network coding scheme based on (多, 多) strong-MDS
  code, which is a generalization of (多, 多) MDS code. We prove that the maintenance
  bandwidth based on our transmission and coding schemes matches the lower bound,
  so the lower bound is tight and the transmission scheme and coding scheme for MCR
  are optimal. We also give numerical comparisons of MCR with other redundancy recovery
  mechanisms in storage cost and maintenance bandwidth to show the advantage of MCR.
