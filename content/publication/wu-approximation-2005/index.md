abstract: Steiner connected dominating set (SCDS) is a generalization of the famous
  connected dominating set problem, where only a specified set of required vertices
  has to be dominated by a connected dominating set, and known to be NP-hard. This
  paper firstly modifies the SCDS algorithm of Guha and Khuller and achieves a worst
  case approximation ratio of (2+1/(m−1))H(min (D, k))+O(1), which outperforms the
  previous best result (c+1)H(min (D, k))+O(1) in the case of mge 1+1/(c−1), where
  c is the best approximation ratio for Steiner tree, D is the maximum degree of the
  graph, k is the cardinality of the set of required vertices, m is an optional integer
  satisfying 0≤ m ≤ min (D, k) and H is the harmonic function. This paper also proposes
  another approximation algorithm which is based on a greedy approach. The second
  algorithm can establish a worst case approximation ratio of 2ln (min (D, k))+O(1),
  which can also be improved to 2ln k if the optimal solution is greater than $$fraçdotetextasciicircum2c+12(c+1)$$.
